**Short answer:** Yes, you can film a police officer in India, but only when they are on duty.

## Things to Keep in Mind

1. **On-Duty Only:** It's legal to film police officers while they’re on duty.
2. **Off-Duty:** Avoid filming officers when they are off duty.
3. **Interference:** Don’t interfere with police work or cause trouble while recording.

## What Laws Apply to Filming Police?

### Right to Privacy

- The Indian Constitution (Article 21) provides the right to privacy.
- However, this right doesn’t fully apply to police officers while they’re performing their public duties. So, filming them doesn’t violate their privacy.

### Legal Framework

- **Kerala Police Act, 2011:** Section 33(2) states that a person cannot be stopped by a police officer from recording their activities, whether in public or private.

### Important Judgments

- **Kolkata High Court Ruling (2008):** Police can’t seize your mobile phone just because you filmed them.

## Legal Precautions

1. **Obstructing a Public Servant (Section 186):** Don’t obstruct or interfere with an officer’s duties. Doing so can lead to jail time and a fine.
2. **Using Force (Section 353):** Using force to prevent an officer from doing their job can result in severe penalties, including imprisonment.

## Tips for Recording Police Officers

1. **Stay Clear:** Make sure your recording doesn’t interfere with the police’s work.
2. **Inform First:** It’s often best to inform the officers that you are recording to avoid conflicts.
3. **Check Local Laws:** Some states may have specific laws about recording police officers. Be sure to know the rules in your area.

**Remember:** Transparency and accountability are important, but it’s equally crucial to let the police do their jobs without hindrance.
